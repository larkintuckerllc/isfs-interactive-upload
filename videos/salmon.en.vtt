00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
In the United States, salmon is the third

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.099
most consumed fish we have. Where does it

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.559
come from? And how do we get it? It's

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.599
actually very dynamic and complex part

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.880
of global food system. If we go back

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.250
about fifty years ago, most salmon came

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.550
from the Pacific Northwest. While

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.460
Alaskan salmon were sold in Japan. A lot of

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.619
fresh product was sold the West coast

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.680
and here on the East Coast it would mostly come

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.529
in as a canned or frozen. There was a lot

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.290
of canned products out here. At the end

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.690
of the seventies, the Norwegians really

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.820
started to make progress on farming salmon.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.129
They started shipping fresh salmon

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.820
into Europe and fresh salmon in to the United

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.370
States.

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.760
This fresh salmon was high quality and

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.879
flown here. It out competed most of the

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:00.100
salmon that was already sold in the

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.870
United States, especially in the East

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:02.769
Coast.

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:05.950
However, the product production tend to

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.159
increase very rapidly and prices

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:10.750
really declined at the end of the

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.420
eighties and nineties. U.S. industry brought

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.430
a case against in the Norwegians and

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:16.840
basically pushed them out of the market

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.860
with a tarif. But, no problem for U.S.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.750
consumers from salmon, because Chile,

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.800
Canada on the East and West coasts scaled

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.110
up their industry rapidly. This is

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.110
financed primarily by Japanese, Norwegian,

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:37.539
and U.S. money. From there salmon started

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:39.070
coming in from the East coast of Canada

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.460
the West coast of Canada and Chile. And in

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.020
the mid-eighties Chileans developed a

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.890
pin bones out portion control fillet. This

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:49.810
really expanded the market in the East

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.229
Coast and Southeast Coast. In the

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:56.050
meantime, the Alaskans started to get

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:00.819
bumped out of the Japanese market because

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:04.090
Norwegian salmon started going into Japan.

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.719
Russian salmon started going into Japan. And

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:13.060
Chilean salmon started going into Japan. Then

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.010
the Alaskans realized in order to

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:16.510
compete in the U.S. market they need to

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.110
cut their costs of processing. So in recent

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.500
years

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.150
Alaska has been sending as much as a

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.930
third their salmon into China for

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.940
processing. And then that sent sent back

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.720
and sold in the United States. So we got

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.549
a very complex and dynamic system here.

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:35.590
That's what we're studying at the

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.660
University of Florida. That's where we're

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.040
going to be training the next generation of people.

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:46.530
Thank you.
